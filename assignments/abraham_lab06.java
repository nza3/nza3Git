 *Program Name:   CSC 111 Lab 06
 *Author:   Naif Abraham III
 *Date:     Sept. 30, 2015
 *Course/Section:  CSC 111-003W
 *Program Description:  This program prompt the user to enter how many 
 *                      grades he/she would like the program to average.  
 *                      It will then display the running and final 
 *                      average once all of the user's input has been 
 *                      accepted.
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                          Initial Algorithm:
 * 1. Get total number of grades the user wishes to enter.
 * 2. Get that number of grades, display the running sum of grades.
 * 3. Display final average to the user.
 *
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                             Input Data:
 * 1. The user will input the maximum number of grades he/she wishes to 
 *    add (maxCount).
 * 2. The user will enter maxCount # of grades (grades).
 * 3. The user will input whether or not to run the program again (reply).   
 *
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                             Output Data:
 * 1. The program will output the total number of grades the user wishes
 *    to input (maxCount).
 * 2. The program will output the running grade average (gradeAverage).
 * 3. The program will display how many grades the user entered out of
 *    total maxCount.
 *
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                               Formulas:
 * 1.    gradeSum = grade + gradeSum
 *    Where the entered grade will be added to running total to form the 
 *    new running total.
 * 2.    gradeAverage = gradeSum / (count + 1)
 *    Where the gradeAverage will be displayed after  each entry, then 
 *    again after the final entry.  The average will be determined by
 *    the running total [Formula 2] divided by the total number of ent-
 *    ries; in this case, the count was initialized to 0, so the actual
 *    count must be increased by 1 to yield the correct divisor.
 *
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                         Refined Algorithm:
 * 1. Prompt the user for the total number of grades he/she wishes to 
 *    enter into the program.
 * 2. Get number (n) from user.
 * 3. If the number (n) is greater than zero, proceed to step 4.
 *    3a.   If the number (n) is less than or equal to zero, prompt user
 *          with an error message.
 * 4. Get 1 of n grades from the user.
 * 5. If the entry is greater than or equal to zero, proceed to step 6.
 *    5a.   If the entry is less than zero, prompt the user to enter a
 *          valid number.  [Formula 1]
 * 6. Add each grade entered to the previous total to get gradeSum.  (The
 *    first entry will simply be grade entered + 0.)
 * 7. Increase the count/total number of grades entered by 1 for each
 *    grade the user enters.
 * 8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 until the total number of grades have
 *    been entered.
 * 9. Display the final average.
 * 10.Prompt the user with a Y/N question to see if the user would like 
 *    to run the program again.
 *    10a.  If the user enters "Y" or presses [Enter]/[Return], repeat
 *          steps 1 through 10.
 *    10b.  If the user enters "N" or any other value, end program.
 *
